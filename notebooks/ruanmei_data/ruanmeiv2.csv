VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_101|Hello. I hope I didn't startle you.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_102|This is a work habit of mine — using touch to open my senses and letting the details of your biological existence flood into my brain helps me understand your construction as a living organism.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_103|Such is the basis of deconstruction and reconstruction. Do not be concerned. You are very healthy — in fact, impeccably so. A perfect experimental specimen. I like perfect experimental specimens.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_104|Yes, I'm happy to meet you too. We've met before in the Simulated Universe.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_105|Oh? Really?
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_106|I expect the views here had me lost in thought...
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_107|I don't usually go in and out of the space station, and only discovered today that it was blessed with such calm, open views. It is a wonderful fit for the sweet fragrance of lotus leaves, plum blossom, sticky rice, and frosting sugar.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_108|Come here. Look, the blue planet is directly below us. It is so full of life. This dessert is very delicious. Here, take half.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_109|You don't like it? I worked very hard on it. You should at least have a try.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_110|Delicious desserts remind people of how flowers look when they bloom. Ingest this dessert one bite at a time, and the sweetness will linger in your mouth.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_111|I hope you like it too.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_112|So, what do you think? I can certainly prepare more for you. It's become somewhat of a tradition to bring strawberry pastries when I visit Stephen Lloyd. His attendance seems quite dependent on them.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_113|Mmm, an outstanding dessert. Ten grams of cubed sugar, one dried and salt-preserved plum blossom. Baking and cooking are the same as nurturing a universe. The heat must be controlled, planning must be meticulous, and one must not panic... no matter what happens.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_114|Unfortunately, there are still too many people in the space station. The clamor is not fitting for desserts. By the way...
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_115|do you remember what my "research" is about?
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_116|I see. What a cute hobby.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_117|But remember, the next time something like this happens it's crucial to mask your expression until you've ascertained the situation. If not...
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_118|...you'll be full of weaknesses that others can see through.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_119|Let's try again. Now, what else would you like to ask?
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_120|You have quite the appetite. Alright, I'll give you the recipe.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_121|Come and have a walk with me. A stroll is the most appropriate post-dessert activity.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_122|As the masses depart, there's an enveloping calm here, just like in the "No Man's Land" I've ventured to in the past.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_123|Can you imagine a completely lifeless world?
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_124|From there, you can glimpse the stars that lie at the very edge of the horizon.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_125|Following its celestial trajectory, the great teal star illuminates an endless sea of white across both the sky and land.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_126|My mother and I navigated calm glaciers looking for signs of life on that world... and encountered many bizarre phenomena.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_127|It was like finding the single correct piece in a mountain of jigsaw pieces. The process was convoluted and unimaginably difficult, but it was touching and enthralling as well.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_128|From then on, whenever I come across a familiar scene, I find myself pausing to take it all in.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_129|My apologies, it appears my words have left you perplexed. PleaA few days ago, I made my interest in you known to Herta. My intention is for you to serve as an "assistant." Based on our interactions within the Simulated Universe, I firmly believe you fit the bill.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_131|I find extending trust beyond myself is challenging. A single error in detailed research can generate issues, and I despise matters that escape my control.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_132|Therefore, I added Anti-Truth Serum to this dessert. It will not harm you. However, you will be unable to say what you truly think when answering questions related to me.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_133|Treat it as a layer of protection. This will shield my research and your personal safety. Once the problems have been dealt with, I'll give you the antidote.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_134|I can also reward you as compensation for being my assistant. I will fulfill your every wish.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_135|Yes... problems wrought by my own hand.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_136|Does that bother you? I believe we will be able to be frank with each other, but that needs time.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_137|Then I'll grant you even greater rewards.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_138|When I first arrived on the space station, I borrowed the Phase Flame from Herta — it's an invention of member #29 Sserkal. I hoped to be enlightened by other Society members' results.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_139|A surge of creativity led me to explore the cultivation of life on the space station.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_140|In my imagination, these lifeforms would be a new variety that are born as geniuses. I planned to name them after Lambda, member #8 of the Genius Society...
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_141|I don't know where it went wrong. They possess their own sentience, but are nowhere near geniuses.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_142|Moreover, my "free-range" approach seems to have backfired. In a lab leak incident a few days ago, some of these "little lifeforms" ran away and scattered all over the space station.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_143|I do not wish for Herta or Asta to be involved in this. Therefore... I'm hoping you can assist in recovering these little lifeforms.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_144|I do trust you.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_145|This has nothing to do with them. Besides, the more people involved, the more problems there will be.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_146|The researchers are still treating these entities as visitors... I want to steer clear of making my presence known, so as not to cause undue disturbances.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_147|I entrust this to you. Once the little lifeforms are collected, simply find a proper place for them. The researchers in the Department of Ecology should know about this and provide you with suitable advice.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_148|As the masses depart, there's an enveloping calm here... just like the "No Man's Land" I ventured to in the past.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_149|Yes. My mother and I once spent 11 long polar nights there.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_158|...You wish to kick Stephen out?
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_159|What if the responder is Polka Kakamond?
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_160|...Can we ask him to leave if we are to discuss this topic? The process will be long... and boring. There's no need to take up other people's time.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_161|Alright, let me walk you out.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_162|Seems like a programming error.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_163|It's probably an isolated glitch.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_164|I probably will. Records indicate likes this Occurrence.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_165|Come along, I'll see you out.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_166|It appears I was overthinking things. Impulsive behavior is pretty characteristic of her after all.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_167|Thankfully, it was just a minor scare. Still, meetings give me such a headache... It seems I'll have to stay put for a while.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_168|I see that you've recovered the lifeform in the master control zone. Thank you, well done.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_169|I was simply being overly cautious. It is a habit of mine. Apologies.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_170|No. You misunderstand. While Herta is tied up in meetings, you might find it more convenient to roam the space station.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_171|There are some things that I must tell you now. If I wait for the meeting to finish... then it might be too late.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_172|The retrieval of my lifeforms isn't complete yet. There's more than just one, and some are stored in a sealed zone.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_173|Herta uses that place to welcome visitors from across the stars, or to welcome members of the Genius Society. However, due to the Legion's invasion, it is no longer open to the public.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_174|And now my "headache" is stored there.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_175|There's much you don't know about the space station, and even more about Herta.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_176|But there is some information I can give you. That place is also used to welcome non-humanoid visitors and has a shuttle that connects to outer space.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_177|She gave me permission and said no more.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_178|I'm giving you my access card. Give me your hand, and I'll input your fingerprint into it.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_179|Stay vigilant. Should you come across a threat you can't handle, just alert me. I'll come to your aid, no matter what.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_180|Remember, there is a giant... incubator... in the middle of the zone. That's where my "headache" is stored.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_181|Once you're back, come find me on the railway platform. Then you'll understand everything.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_208|The meeting of geniuses is over. As for the future of the Simulated Universe... That conclusion isn't important. What's important is your task.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_209|You look... upset, correct? I regret my actions. There's no defending what I've done. Time and again, my experiments have fallen short, and they've always yielded predictable results.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_210|I made a clone, but it... doesn't hold a candle to the Emanator.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_211|Exactly as predicted: 56 seconds, on the dot.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_212|How should I have explained it to you? I'm not good at communicating with others...
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_213|Restrained by time and place, its code of life could only be considered an incomplete attempt. I managed to replicate the moment it was born, however, it would soon disappear and be reduced to particles.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_214|Like every living being, it inevitably faced its demise as it journeyed towards the end — I find no fault in that.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_215|However, even the briefest life should have meaning. I want to know the limits of its capacity. It will indicate how far I've gone in a field completely incomprehensible to me.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_216|Haha, and it was "a minuscule step" — just as I had predicted.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_217|I did say that if a danger proved too great for you, I would personally step in to confront it.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_218|Indeed, this is how I keep the distractions at bay. I have to admit that research once made me obsessive — that wasn't a good period in my life, though I now navigate it much more smoothly.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_219|I do not have a life outside of research. People always think this price is unimaginable, but it seems rather acceptable to me.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_220|I must admit, I'm not fond of scenarios where everything aligns perfectly with my expectations. An experiment should have its unforeseen twists.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_221|That's where the joy lies. Even the most predictable storylines can have their pleasant surprises.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_222|I have to admit that these little ones born in the process... sometimes move me.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_223|I see a human-like response in them. It is a concept completely opposite to that of divinity — they have emotions.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_224|Emotions may be either positive or negative. However, the love rooted in the depths of their heart is eternal and unchanging.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_225|They are still a long way from becoming geniuses and are therefore unable to discern whether this love is one of friendship, romance, or familial love.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_226|That being said, can even geniuses tell the difference? I cannot, at least... I do not understand what "love" is and cannot respond to their feelings.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_227|do you believe my actions were wrong?
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_228|There is no need to tell me your answer. I just... felt like asking the question. How should I take care of them? Perhaps leaving them at the space station is the best choice.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_229|Do I seem irresponsible? I'm sorry. I am often at a loss as to how to face my own creations.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_230|The effects of the Anti-Truth Serum will also wear off. If others mention me to you in the future, you can answer however you like, or even pretend you never knew me.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_231|After all, your memory of me will soon dissipate like smoke.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_232|Over time, hidden truths tend to surface. Past traumas, which I'd rather leave behind, have made me skeptical about trusting anyone but myself.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_233|If I do not want a secret revealed, the most foolproof way is to destroy it. The Anti-Truth Serum will make you forget the brief period we spent together.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_234|It won't take effect immediately. It is a slow, intangible process — like the sweet fragrance of lotus leaves, plum blossom, sticky rice, and frosting sugar.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_235|Perhaps you will remember someone performed selfish experiments on the space station, but you will no longer remember their identity. Perhaps we will meet again someday, but you won't be able to connect me with the recollection.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_236|That way, the connection between lifeforms will be erased. Friendships, secrets, grudges, lies, all will disappear.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_237|It will make our lives... more relaxing.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_238|Thank you.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_239|I believe you.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_240|Screwllum will stay on the space station for a while longer. He and Herta still have problems they need to solve. As for me, I'm leaving soon and won't bother with goodbyes.
VO_side0_rm_ruanmei_241|Do you still remember the "No Man's Land" I mentioned? I'm considering a solo trip back there during my research downtime, just to see how things are.
